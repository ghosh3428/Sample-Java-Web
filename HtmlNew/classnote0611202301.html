        Kolkata (UK: /kɒlˈkɑːtə/[13] or /kɒlˈkʌtə/,[14] US: /koʊlˈkɑːtɑː/,[15] Bengali: [kolˈkata] ⓘ, IAST: Kolkātā;
        also known as Calcutta /kælˈkʌtə/[14][15] which was the official name until 2001) is the capital and largest
        city of the Indian state of West Bengal. It lies on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, 80 km (50 mi) west of
        the border with Bangladesh. It is the primary financial and commercial center of eastern and northeastern
        India.[16] Kolkata is the seventh most populous city of India with an estimated city proper population of 4.5
        million (0.45 crore).[17] It is the centre of the Kolkata Metropolitan Region, which is one of the most populous
        metropolitan areas in the world being 3rd in India; 2nd in Bengal Region; 13th in Asia and 16th in the world
        with a population of over 15 million (1.5 crore). Kolkata is the de facto cultural capital of India and
        historically and culturally significant city in the historic region of Bengal.[1][18][19] It is the second
        largest Bengali-speaking city in the world. It has the highest number of nobel laureates among all cities in
        India.
    </p>
    <p>
        The three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty. After the
        Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690,[20] the area was developed by the Company into
        Fort William. Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied the fort in 1756 but was defeated at the Battle of Plassey in 1757,
        after his general Mir Jafar mutinied in support of the Company, and was later made the Nawab for a brief
        time.[21] Under company and later crown rule, Calcutta served as the de facto capital of India until 1911.
        Calcutta was the second largest city in the British Empire, after London,[22] and was the center of bureaucracy,
        politics, law, education, science and the arts in India. The city was associated with many of the figures and
        movements of the Bengali Renaissance. It was the hotbed of the Indian nationalist movement.[23] The University
        of Calcutta and its affiliated colleges produced many leading figures of South Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kolkata's architecture includes many imperial landmarks, including the Victoria Memorial, Howrah Bridge and the
        Grand Hotel. The city's heritage includes India's only Chinatown and remnants of Jewish, Armenian, Greek and
        Anglo-Indian communities. The city is closely linked with Bhadralok culture and the Zamindars of Bengal,
        including Bengali Hindu, Bengali Muslim and tribal aristocrats. The partition of Bengal affected the fortunes of
        the city. In the late 20th century, the city hosted the government-in-exile of Bangladesh during the Pakistani
        Civil War in 1971;[24] it built India's first subway; and it was overtaken by Mumbai (formerly Bombay) as
        India's largest city. The Port of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port. The city is often regarded as
        India's cultural capital.

        Following independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the premier centre of Indian commerce, culture, and
        politics, suffered many decades of political violence and economic stagnation before it rebounded.[25] The city
        was also flooded with Hindu refugees from East Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) in the decades following the 1947
        partition of India, transforming its landscape and shaping its politics.[26][27] A demographically diverse city,
        the culture of Kolkata features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods (paras) and
        freestyle conversations (adda). Kolkata is home to venerable institutions of national importance, including the
        Academy of Fine Arts, the Asiatic Society, the Indian Museum and the National Library of India. It is the center
        of the Indian Bengali film industry, which is known as Tollywood. Among scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts
        the Geological Survey of India, the Botanical Survey of India, the Calcutta Mathematical Society, the Indian
        Science Congress Association, the Zoological Survey of India, the Horticultural Society, the Institution of
        Engineers, the Anthropological Survey of India and the Indian Public Health Association. Four Nobel laureates
        and two Nobel Memorial Prize winners are associated with the city.[28] Though home to major cricketing venues
        and franchises, Kolkata stands out in India for being the country's centre of association football. Kolkata is
        known for its grand celebrations of the Hindu festival of Durga Puja, which is recognized by UNESCO for its
        importance to world heritage.[29] Hence, Kolkata is also known as the 'City of Joy'.[30]

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        The word Kolkata (Bengali: কলকাতা [kolˈkata]) derives from Kôlikata (Bengali: কলিকাতা [ˈkɔliˌkata]), the Bengali
        language name of one of three villages that predated the arrival of the British; the other two villages were
        Sutanuti and Govindapur.[31]
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several explanations for the etymology of this name:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Kolikata is thought to be a variation of Kalikkhetrô (Bengali: কালীক্ষেত্র [ˈkaliˌkʰetrɔ]), meaning 'Field
            of [the goddess] Kali'. Similarly, it can be a variation of Kalikshetra (Sanskrit: कालीक्षेत्र, lit. 'area
            of Goddess Kali').
        </li>
        <li>
            Another theory is that the name derives from Kalighat.[32]
        </li>
        <li>
            Alternatively, the name may have been derived from the Bengali term kilkila (Bengali: কিলকিলা), or 'flat
            area'.[33]
        </li>
        <li>
            The name may have its origin in the words khal (Bengali: খাল [ˈkʰal]) meaning 'canal', followed by kaṭa
            (Bengali: কাটা [ˈkaʈa]), which may mean 'dug'.[34]
        </li>
        <li>
            According to another theory, the area specialised in the production of quicklime or koli chun (Bengali: কলি
            চুন [ˈkɔliˌtʃun]) and coir or kata (Bengali: কাতা [ˈkata]); hence, it was called Kolikata).[33]
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Although the city's name has always been pronounced Kolkata or Kôlikata in Bengali, the anglicised form Calcutta
        was the official name until 2001, when it was changed to Kolkata in order to match Bengali pronunciation.[35]

        he discovery and archaeological study of Chandraketugarh, 35 km (22 mi) north of Kolkata, provide evidence that
        the region in which the city stands has been inhabited for over two millennia.[36][37] Kolkata's recorded
        history began in 1690 with the arrival of the English East India Company, which was consolidating its trade
        business in Bengal. Job Charnock is often regarded as the founder of the city[38]; however, in response to a
        public petition,[39] the Calcutta High Court ruled in 2003 that the city does not have a founder.[40] The area
        occupied by the present-day city encompassed three villages: Kalikata, Gobindapur and Sutanuti. Kalikata was a
        fishing village; Sutanuti was a riverside weavers' village; and Gobindapur was a trading post for Indian
        merchant princes. These villages were part of an estate belonging to the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family of
        zamindars. The estate was sold to the East India Company in 1698.[41]: 1

    <p>In 1712, the British completed the construction of Fort William, located on the east bank of the Hooghly River to
        protect their trading factory.[42] Facing frequent skirmishes with French forces, the British began to upgrade
        their fortifications in 1756. The Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah, condemned the militarisation and tax evasion
        by the company. His warning went unheeded, and the Nawab attacked; his capture of Fort William led to the
        killings of several East India company officials in the Black Hole of Calcutta.[43] A force of Company soldiers
        (sepoys) and British troops led by Robert Clive recaptured the city the following year.[43] Per the 1765 Treaty
        of Allahabad following the battle of Buxar, East India company was appointed imperial tax collector of the
        Mughal emperor in the province of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, while Mughal-appointed Nawabs continued to rule the
        province.[44] Declared a presidency city, Calcutta became the headquarters of the East India Company by
        1773.[45]</p>
