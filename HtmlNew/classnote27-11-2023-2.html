            <p class="offset-md-1 col-md-4 text-success">I need to make a multi-column layout only for the purpose of printing. So now I'm using
                Chromium 85 but I can
                switch to anything else because I only need to provide support for a single browser. I'm also free to
                use
                pretty much any CSS/JS library if it may help to solve the issue.</p>
            <p class="col-md-3 text-danger">I'm trying to implement a very basic multi-column layout. Everything works fine except
                for the fact that I
                can not avoid widowed headers. The break-after: avoid instruction does not work for some reason.</p>
            <p class="col-md-4 text-info">The recipe will be much simpler if you only need to consider HTML output, because
                arranging HTML elements
                side by side is relatively simple via CSS. It will be even simpler if you only need to arrange the text
                output of a code chunk side by side. Below is the first example:</p>
